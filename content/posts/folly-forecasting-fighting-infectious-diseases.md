The folly of forecasting and fighting infectious diseases.


This talk, funnily enough, is most likely to be redundant to you the esteemed members of this little social club in the upper spaces of this cozy little speakeasy.

I guess you can't really call it a speakeasy any longer what with the expired mandates and all.
But I choose to continue to call it that, its my subtle way of stressing how seriously I take each attempt to change our very way of life. To erase what it means, in my opinion, to be human.

In order to make this an evergreen talk and to give the best evidence possible we'll go from the present day in April of 2021 all the way back to 2009 and 8, a slight meandering through 1981-1987 and even as far back as 1918.


This talk is hopefully new to you, but if it isn't I admire your curiosity. I have attempted to learn what actual data my friends and family have consumed on their pathway to placing trust in certain experts and I've found that they haven't been exposed to much of the data at all. They simply haven't cared at all to look...all the while caring enough to change their behaviour in rather bizarre ways.

Back in 2015 or 16 Ben Shapiro popularized the phrase, "Facts don't care about your feelings." Yet less than five years later the world in which we live has shown me more than ever that "feelings do not care about your facts!"

Those feelings, unchecked, can lead to folly. The first folly is the inherent inaccuracies of forecasting the effects of infectious diseases.

Neil Ferguson needs to #learntocode. [Before the world was allowed to set eyes on his mathematical models they were contained in a single file all fifteen thousand lines of it][5]. Some lines were translated from Fortran, some produced data corruption, and some, I assume, are good functions.

Now this is a topic with which I'm let's say not unfamiliar. Due to bugs, the code can produce very [different results given identical inputs][6]. It's unfit for scientific purposes but this is the very foundation on which lockdowns are based.

Even if Ferguson could code, given his history with the H1N1 crisis of 2008 or bird flu, or mad cow, or foot and mouth disease, it is clear that [he doesn't know what he's doing][7].

Now, people have a hard time understanding very large numbers. If I told you that official claims of Covid related deaths did not make for a statistically significant bump in all cause mortality over the span of the last fifteen years that abstract concept would mean absolutely nothing. I wanted to buy marbles to represent the idea and to make clear visual comparison of Neil Ferguson's past predictions. I'm borrowing the idea from a talk I once watched related to US immigration as relayed using gumballs. I don't eat gumballs, and there's no way in hell am I going to purchase that much sugar, so thought marbles, let's do marbles instead.

But his predictions are so consistently large I'd have had to buy over four thousand marbles just to convey is errant bird flu predictions. So I'm resorting to computer graphics instead.


BSE (Mad Cow): 136,000 vs 2826
Bird Flu H7N9 of 2005: 200M vs 616
Swine Flu H1N1 2009: 65,000 vs 457

Now, each of these squares represent 100 deaths. Each one regrettable, senseless and tragic, yet each of Neil Ferguson's predictions are so unlike reality that "deaths of despair" related to non-therapeutic interventions outpace them by multiple factors.

If that's not bad enough, if you drill down through the data over the years you come to the conclusion that "Fauci doesn't know anything about anything."[8]

We knew, if we studied Hegel at all, that there was going to be a repressive swing back after the 1960s. The popularity of drugs, sex and rock and roll waxes and wanes.

By the time 1979 rolls around and a few researchers think they've hit upon the cause of a strange illness in hard-partying homosexual men they cannot get congress and the NIH to fund their work to save a few "undesirables".

So they performed a slight of hand. The trick was to convince everyone that HIV was the cause of AIDS and that the risks were spread out equally over homosexual and heterosexual demographics regardless of age and other recreational behaviour.

There are seven other diagnoses that have the same symptomatic breakdown as AIDS: tuberculosis, malaria, cytomegalovirus, syphilis, parasites, cancer, pneaumonias. 

That's what the CDC pulled off, take this poison until you die because otherwise you might just die.

Science isn't a belief. Scientists are not supposed to believe anything. Scientists are supposed to have some evidence that leads them tentatively to some conclusion or to some action. They're supposed to be able to show that to other scientists or any interested person who's willing to understand what it is that was used as evidence and to allow that person to say, "yeah, I agree with that. That makes sense." Using rules of inference that we had since the time of Aristotle, it's not complicated at all...an eigth grader should be able to handle it.

Science is not a set of beliefs.

Are we even living through a pandemic? What even is a pandemic? According to the World Health Organization (WHO) a pandemic [*was][1] a larger occurrence of epidemics or outbreaks that ranges worldwide and causes "enormous numbers of deaths and illness".

Incentives matter. There are signed agreements by many countries in the world that benefit semi-private organizations, namely, vaccine manufacturers. These agreements automatically authorize the purchasing of millions of dollars worth of vaccines in preparation for a pandemic, assuming there are no other therapeutic options or that the general human population has no known immunity. In fact, there are no refunds for those large purchases that each country agrees to make, in the end, [they give them away][2]. What a waste of money that governments must first extract from their citizens.

When the W.H.O. changed their definition of a pandemic prior to the H1N1 "pandemic" [(which did not cause enormous amounts of deaths)][3] there was so much of a scandal that the WHO had to cover up the incident as reported by [James Corbett of the Corbett Report][4].


All you have to offer to the world is what is unequal about you.


Forecasting





Fighting

My wife once said to me, "everyone has access to the same information you do."

This was said to indicate that maybe its my interpretation that is divergent and not the underlying data. The simple truth is very few people have looked at the underlying data.

People are still responsible for their own decisions, much in the same ways humans were thousands of years ago
