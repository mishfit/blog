Are We Living through a Pandemic?

What even is a pandemic? According to the World Health Organization (WHO) a pandemic [*was*](https://web.archive.org/web/20090418142949/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/pandemic/en/) a larger occurrence of epidemics (outbreaks) that ranges worldwide and causes "enormous numbers of deaths and illness".

Incentives matter. There are signed agreements by many countries in the world that benefit semi-private organizations, namely, vaccine manufacturers. These agreements automatically authorize the purchasing of millions of dollars
worth of vaccines in preparation for a pandemic, assuming there are no other therapeutic options or that the general human population has no known immunity. In fact, there are no refunds for those large purchases that each country agrees to make, in the end, they give them away: https://web.archive.org/web/20120910142305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20811077.html. What a waste of money that governments must first extract from taxpayers.

When the WHO changed their definition of a pandemic prior to the H1N1 "pandemic" (which did not cause enormous amounts of deaths). (https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-apr-30-sci-swine-reality30-story.html). There was so much of a scandal that the WHO had to cover up the incident as reported here: https://www.corbettreport.com/articles/20100413_who_coverup.htm. 

How does this pertain to the so-called 2019-2020 Sars Cov-2 pandemic? My claim is that there is not an enormous amount of death. Additionally, the deaths that most people think are there are not causally linked to the Sars Cov-2 virus.

Bold claims, I know, but it is important to understand what is a case and how that has changed very recently, with no good reason.


But first! It is important to remember that medical errors are the third most frequent cause of death in the United States. Why is this not well known? The incentives are all wrong. Remember, Incentives Matter.

Causes of death are calculated based on billing codes (remember CPTs?). There are no billable codes for "medical error" as Dr. Martin Makary of John Hopkins University will tell you. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lDcWx3k0-0). The direct research here (https://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139) indicates that the third leading burden on death in America is medical error.

Now saying something like "3rd leading cause of death" doesn't really hit people...how about this, the estimate turns out to be around 251,000 people a year. That number sure does sound suspiciously like the number of people who are claimed to have died of Covid-19. Even if it were not nefarious it would put Covid-19 into perspective.

Why is this so important that I had to make it a tangent? Because while all cause mortality was not statistically different over the entire year of 2020 there was a sharp increase in March through May of 2020.

And this is why, doctors and elderly care facilities were killing their patients.

As the Wall Street Journal reports in a December 2020 article titled "Hospitals Retreat From Early Covid Treatment and Return to Basics" (https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-retreat-from-early-covid-treatment-and-return-to-basics-11608491436) the mode of treatment used in 2020 was not standard. In fact, the health care industry had to return to treating patients like they did before the pandemic, if you want to call it that.

That begs the question? How did they used to treat patients? And why did they treat them differently in 2020?

Doctors, nurses and other health professionals were afraid of contracting the disease. This is understandable. There was very little known about the disease at the time. So they put patients on ventilators early...and often. "The aim", they say was not because this was best practice for respiratory illnesses but because it was "to save the seriously ill and protect hospital staff from Covid-19."

What most people do not know is that ventilators do harm to the soft tissue of the lungs. If you need a ventilator you are generally less than 50% likely to survive in the first place. Putting people on ventilators that do not need to be on ventilators can be a death sentence as a nurse working in New York claimed late in April of 2020. (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8262351/Nurse-New-York-claims-city-killing-COVID-19-patients-putting-ventilators.html).

This is echoed in an article by the Federalist Papers on the same subject: https://thefederalistpapers.org/us/shock-physician-claims-early-covid-patients-put-risky-sedation-ventilators-protect-hospital-staff.

Okay, so deaths were occuring...some of which were due to medical error. What did excess mortality actually look like?

Johns Hopkins University published a paper covering it, and retracted it due to political pressure...they didn't even assert that anything in the report was wrong. You can see it as it was published in November of 2020 (thanks to the internet archive): https://web.archive.org/web/20201126163323/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19.

Then you can take a look at Europe, over the course of the last 5 years all cause mortality barely blips: https://euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps#z-scores-by-country.

The media has not been without fault in drumming up a scare. Countless stories of young marathon runners and young people who died from the disease when in fact, this is very rare as can be seen by the report from John Hopkins University.

That's probably enough to leave you with some reading and research to do. I beg you to consider each point and attack the arguments not the sources, I've tried hard to use sources I think you will believe...but the important thing by the end of this ordeal is that you will see that "official" sources are not as trustworthy as you might imagine.
