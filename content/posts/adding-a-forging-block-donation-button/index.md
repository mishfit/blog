I'm currently setting up an account at ForgingBlock](https://forgingblock.io/). It's a new cryptocurrency-based payment gateway that appears to be non-custodial. This is huge.

They're not as political as other payment gateways that exist out there either. I'm quite impressed. Below is the payment button I generated after setting up an account with them:


{{< rawhtml >}}
<div>
	<a class="buy-with-crypto"
		href="https://api.forgingblock.io/fund/328a105f1afce852a9bd80479fcac3e1a9e7/5.00"
		target="_blank">
		<img src="https://forgingblock.io/img/donate-with-forgingblock.png" />
	</a>
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}
